# rh-advisories pipeline

Tekton pipeline to release content to registry.redhat.io registry and create an advisory.
This is a copy of v3.0.0 of the rh-push-to-registry-redhat-io pipeline, but with the advisory
tasks added in. The plan is for this pipeline to eventually be deleted and take the place of
the rh-push-to-registry-redhat-io pipeline.
