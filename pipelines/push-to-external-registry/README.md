## Changes in 5.1.0
* Add tasks `collect-registry-token-secret` and `make-repo-public`
  * `collect-registry-token-secret` will get the secret containing the token to access quay.io API
  * `make-repo-public` will use the token in the secret to make repositories in mapping public,
    if requested

## Changes in 5.0.0
* Drop the `enterpriseContractPublicKey` param. The verify task will take the value from the policy.

## Changes in 4.8.0
* Add `requireInternalServices` parameter to the 'verify-access-to-resources' task.

## Changes in 4.7.2
* Increase `enterpriseContractTimeout` parameter default value.

## Changes in 4.7.0
* Removed `verify-access-to-resources` script and replaced it with a task.

## Changes in 4.6.0
* The `push-snapshot` task now gets the `resultsDirPath` parameter from `collect-data` results

## Changes in 4.5.0
* Add the task `update-cr-status` at the end of the pipeline to save all pipeline results

## Changes in 4.4.0
* The apply-mapping task now gets the dataPath parameter instead of releasePlanAdmissionPath

## Changes in 4.3.0
* `enterpriseContractExtraRuleData` added as a pipeline parameter, which is
  then passed to EC. Allows for easier runtime changes to rule data.

## Changes in 4.2.0
* update the taskGitUrl default value due to migration
  to konflux-ci GitHub org

## Changes in 4.0.1
* Added `when` clause to `push-snapshot` task in the pipeline to ensure it only executes when
  the `apply-mapping` task indicates that mapping was successful.

## Changes in 4.0.0
* releaseServiceConfig added as a pipeline parameter that is passed to the collect-data task

## Changes in 3.0.0
* Parameters supplied by the Release Service operator now use camelCase format

## Changes in 2.2.0
* Modified the pipeline to dynamically source the `data.json`, `snapshot_spec.json` and
  `release_plan_admission.json` files from the results of the `collect-data` task.

## Changes in 2.1.1
* The cleanup-workspace task now receives a pipelineRunUid parameter to cleanup InternalRequests

## Changes in 2.1.0
* taskGitRevision no longer has a default. It will be provided by the operator and will always have the same value as
  the git revision in the PipelineRef definition of the PipelineRun if using a git resolver. See RHTAPREL-790 for details

## Changes in 2.0.0
* Pipeline renamed from `release` to `push-to-external-registry`

## Changes in 1.2.0

* Remove extraConfig parameters as the information is now passed in the RPA data field
* Remove the git clone task
* Fix apply-mapping parameters

## Changes in 0.21.0
* Remove releasestrategy parameter

## Changes in 0.20.0
* Introduce new initial task - verify-access-to-resources
    * protection to verify that service accounts have required permissions to access
      resources before we start a pipeline.
    * If verification does not pass, the pipeline fails

## Changes in 0.19
* update Tekton API to v1
    * includes bumping all tasks to versions that use Tekton API v1

## Changes in 0.18
* explicitly set IGNORE_REKOR value to "true" in the verify-enterprise-contract task
* use git resolvers for the verify-enterprise-contract task
    - the verify_ec_task_bundle parameter was placed with verify_ec_task_git_url,
      verify_ec_task_git_revision, and verify_ec_task_git_pathInRepo
- add new enterpriseContractPublicKey parameter

* use PipelineRun UID for subdirectory inside the workspace
    * this will avoid the issue of parallel PipelineRuns overriding each other's data

    * and specify snapshotPath for this task to point to the subdir

* git resolvers are used in place of release bundle resolvers

## Changes in 0.15
* the push-snapshot task was updated to version 0.9 to use `cosign copy` instead of `skopeo copy`

      and releasestrategy as pipeline parameters
* the snapshot parameter is now a namespaced name instead of a JSON string

* the verify_ec_task_bundle parameter was added
    * with this addition, the verify-enterprise-contract task version is no longer static

* addGitShaTag now defaults to true instead of false

## Changes in 0.11
* Use version 0.4 of apply-mapping task and set the new failOnEmptyResult parameter to true
    * This will ensure that if the result of mapping is an empty component list, the task will fail
