## Changes in 3.1.0
* added support for OCI artifacts.

## Changes in 3.0.0
* `images.pushSourceContainer` is no longer supported
* `commonTags` parameter removed in favor of component tags in the snapshot spec file

## Changes in 2.7.0
* Updated the base image used in this task

## Changes in 2.6.0
* The task now looks for tags in each component of the snapshot spec file and uses them instead of commonTags if any exist

## Changes in 2.5.0
* Add support for checking the `mapping` key for `pushSourceContainer`
  * Can be per component or in the `mapping.defaults` section
  * The legacy location of `images.pushSourceContainer` will be removed in a future version

## Changes in 2.4.0
* When pushing source containers, the origin is now determined using `$repo:${digest}.src` instead of `$repo:${git_sha}.src`
  that was used previously. This follows a change in the build service.
  * We now also push this new tag, so sign it as well.

## Changes in 2.3.0
* remove `dataPath` and `snapshotPath` default values

## Changes in 2.2.3
* Add `set -e` to the task script, so it can fail if the `wait-for-ir` script exits with a non-zero status code, when at
  least one of the InternalRequests has not succeeded

## Changes in 2.2.2
* An InternalRequest is now created to sign source containers

## Changes in 2.2.1
* An InternalRequest is now created to sign the both the registry.redhat.io and registry.access.redhat.com references
  * This change comes with a bump in the image used for the task

## Changes in 2.2.0
* Support was added to handle the signing of multi-arch images

## Changes in 2.1.0
* Use the translate-delivery-repo util for translating the reference variable
  * This change comes with a bump in the image used for the task

## Changes in 2.0.0
* The internalrequest CRs are created with a label specifying the pipelinerun uid with the new pipelineRunUid parameter
  * This change comes with a bump in the image used for the task

## Changes in 1.2.0
* Optimize the task to process multiple images in parallel. This will improve the performance of the task.
* Add a new `concurrentLimit` parameter that controls the number of images to be processed in parallel

## Changes since 1.0.1
* Updated hacbs-release/release-utils image to reference redhat-appstudio/release-service-utils image instead

## Changes since 1.0.0
* Translate docker-reference when signing images
  - Before this change, signing request would be sent with the actual quay location of the image. Instead, the reference
    need to be translated to the public facing reference.
    - E.g. quay.io/redhat-prod/rhtas-tech-preview----tuf-server-rhel9:1.0.beta needs to be translated to
      registry.redhat.io/rhtas-tech-preview/tuf-server-rhel9:1.0.beta. Similarly, quay.io/redhat-pending references
      need to be translated to registry.stage.redhat.io.

## Changes since 0.1.0
* Also sign floating tag
  - In addition to pushing $tagPrefix-$timestamp tag, we now also push
    $tagPrefix tag a.k.a. commonTag, so this needs to be signed as well
  - Rename parameter commonTag to commonTags which will contain both tags to sign
