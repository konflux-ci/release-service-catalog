## Changes in 3.2.1
* The InternalRequest will no longer fail, so success/failure check is found from a result on the internal pipelineRun
* The last 2,000 characters of the IIB log is printed

## Changes in 3.2.0
* Changed the way service account secret is determined
  * Setting `.fbc.iibServiceAccountSecret` is no longer allowed (it was never used anyway). Instead, it's based on the stagedIndex setting now.
  * If `.fbc.stagedIndex` is `true`, we'll use `iib-service-account-stage`.
    Otherwise we'll use `iib-service-account-prod`.
  * The reason is that IIB has a priority queue for requests made with our prod
    kerberos principal and we were asked to use it only for prod index requests.

## Changes in 3.1.0
* Updated the base image used in this task

## Changes in 3.0.0
* the task now writes the updated targetIndex to a results json file in the workspace

## Changes in 2.5.0
* updated the base image used in this task

## Changes in 2.4.0
* remove default values of `dataPath` and `snapshotPath` parameters

## Changes in 2.3.2
* add check to fail the task if `fbc.preGA` and `fbc.hotfix` were both set in the `ReleasePlanAdmission` data and
  test for the failing scenario

## Changes in 2.3.1
* fix the error message for the empty value of `issueId`, `productName` and `productVersion`
  with the old format, the backticks caused the string inside (e.g. fbc.issueId) to be executed as a command

## Changes in 2.3.0
* add new result called `indexImageDigests`

## Changes in 2.2.0
* remove requestTimeout parameter and use values defined in RP/RPA
* default build and request timeouts are now 1500 seconds

## Changes in 2.1.0
* add the parameter `targetIndex` to receive the `updated-targetIndex` result from
  the task `update-ocp-tag` as input

## Changes in 2.0.0
* The internalrequest CR is created with a label specifying the pipelinerun uid with the new pipelineRunUid parameter
  * This change comes with a bump in the image used for the task

## Changes in 1.5.0
* add the result `buildTimestamp` to be used in the downstream tasks

## Changes in 1.4.0
* add the possibility of setting a stagedIndex tag

## Changes in 1.3.0
* add the possibility of setting a hotfix tag
* replace the `fbcOptIn` result with `mustSignIndexImage` and `mustPublishIndexImage`
  to control the pipeline flow

## Changes in 1.2.0
* Updated hacbs-release/release-utils image to reference redhat-appstudio/release-service-utils image instead

## Changes in 1.1.0
* add `requestTargetIndex` result
